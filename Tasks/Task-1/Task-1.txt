Task 1 
	What the difference between those:
	
	1- Low Level and High Level?
		Low Level Languages: 
			A)✅ Definition:
				-Low-level languages are very close to the computer’s hardware. They communicate almost directly with the CPU.

			B)Types of Low-Level Language:
				-Machine Language
						Example:
							10101010 00001111
				-Assembly Language
						Example:
							MOV AX, 5
							ADD AX, 3

			C)✅ Advantages:
				-Very fast execution.
				-Full control over memory and hardware.
				-Used in operating systems and embedded systems.

			c)❌ Disadvantages:
				-Hard to learn.
				-Time-consuming to write.
				-Difficult to debug.

		High Level Languages: 
			A)✅ Definition:
				-High-level languages are closer to human language and easier to read and write.

			A)Types of High-Level Language:
				-Python
				-C++
				-Java
				-JavaScript
					Example in python: 
						print("Hello World")

			How They Work:
					-The CPU cannot understand high-level languages directly. They must be translated using:
					-A Compiler (e.g., C++)
					-An Interpreter (e.g., Python)	

	2- Interpreted and Compiled:
		Compiled Languages:
			A)✅ Definition:
				-A compiled language is translated all at once into machine code before it runs.
				-This translation is done by a program called a compiler.
				-🔄 How it works:
					Source Code → Compiler → Executable File → Run
					Once compiled, the program runs directly without needing the compiler again.

			B)📌 Examples:	
				1)C
				2)C++	
					Example (C++):
						#include <iostream>

						int main() {
   							std::cout << "Hello";
						}

			C)✅ Advantages
				1)Faster execution.
				2)Errors are detected before running.
				3)More optimized performance.

			D)❌ Disadvantages
				1)Compilation step takes time.
				2)Platform-dependent (you must compile separately for Windows, Linux, etc.).

		Interpreted Languages: 
			A)✅ Definition:
				-An interpreted language is translated line by line during execution.
				-It uses a program called an interpreter.
				🔄 How it works:
					-Source Code → Interpreter → Executes line by line
					-There is no separate executable file.

			B)📌 Examples:
				-JavaScript
				-Python
					-Example in Python: 
						print("Hello")

			C)✅ Advantages:
				-Easier debugging (stops at the line with error).
				-Platform-independent (if interpreter exists).
				-Faster development cycle.
			
			D)❌ Disadvantages:
				-Slower execution compared to compiled languages.
				-Errors appear during runtime.

	3- Programming and Scripting:
		Programming:
			A)✅ Definition:
				-Programming usually refers to creating standalone applications or software systems using general-purpose programming languages.

			B)🔧 Characteristics:
				-Can build full applications (desktop apps, games, operating systems).
				-More control over memory and hardware.
				-Often compiled into executable files.
				-Suitable for large, complex systems.

			C)📌 Examples:
				-C
				-Java
				-C++
					Example (C++):
						#include <iostream>

						int main() {
   							std::cout << "Hello";
						}

		Scripting:
			A)✅ Definition:
				-Scripting usually refers to writing small programs (scripts) that automate tasks or run inside another program.

			B)🔧 Characteristics:
				-Used for automation.
				-Runs inside an existing environment (browser, shell, server).
				-Faster development.
				-Less control over hardware.

			C)📌 Examples:
				-PHP
				-JavaScript
				-Python
					Example (Python script):	
						print("Task completed")
	
	4- Open Source and Closed Source:
		Open Source Software:
			A)✅ Definition:
				-Open source software makes its source code publicly available.
				-Anyone can view, modify, and distribute the code according to its license.

			B)🔧 Characteristics:
				-Source code is publicly available.
				-Users can modify and improve the software.
				-Community-driven development.
				-Often free (but not always).

			C)📌 Examples:
				-Python
				-Apache HTTP Server
				-Mozilla Firefox
				-Linux
					Example: Linux: Anyone can download the Linux kernel, modify it, and redistribute it under the GPL license.

			D)✅ Advantages:
				-Transparency.
				-Community improvements.
				-High flexibility.
				-Usually free.

			C)❌ Disadvantages:
				-Support may depend on community.
				-No guaranteed updates (depends on project).

		Closed Source (Proprietary) Software:
			A)✅ Definition:
				-Closed source software does not provide access to its source code.
				-Only the company or owner can modify it.

			B)🔧 Characteristics:
				-Source code is hidden.
				-Controlled by a company.
				-Paid license in many cases.
				-Official support provided by the company.

			C)📌 Examples:
				-Microsoft Windows
				-Microsoft Office
				-Adobe Photoshop

			D)✅ Advantages:
				-Professional support.
				-Stable updates from company.
				-Often polished user experience.

			E)❌ Disadvantages:
				-Limited customization.
				-Usually paid.
				-No transparency in internal code.

	5- Languages That Support OOP and Languages That Don't Support OOP:

		🔹 First: What is OOP?
			-OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of:
				-Objects
				-Classes
				-Encapsulation
				-Inheritance
				-Polymorphism

		Languages That Support OOP:
			A)✅ Definition:
				-These languages allow you to create classes and objects and use core OOP principles.

			B)📌 Examples:
				-C#
				-Java
				-Python
				-C++			
					Example (C++):
						class Car {
							public:
    								string brand;
    								void start() {
       		 							cout << "Car started";
    								}
						};

			C)✅ Characteristics of OOP Languages:
				-Support classes and objects.
				-Support encapsulation (private/public).
				-Support inheritance.
				-Support polymorphism.
				-Suitable for large and complex systems.
			
		Languages That Don't Support OOP:
			A)✅ Definition:
				-These languages do not provide built-in support for classes and objects.
				-They usually follow the procedural programming paradigm.

			B)📌 Examples:
				-Pascal
				-C
					Example (C): 
						#include <stdio.h>

						void start() {
    							printf("Car started");
						}

		
		🔹 What Are Procedural Languages?
			-A procedural language is a type of programming language based on the concept of procedure calls (also called functions or routines).
			-In this paradigm, a program is written as a sequence of instructions that are executed step by step.
			-This style is also known as Procedural Programming.

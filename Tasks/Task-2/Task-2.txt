Task 2

What is the difference between float, double, int, short, long, byte, char, and string depends on:
	✅ What type of data they store
	✅ Memory size (in bytes)
	✅ Range of values
	✅ Precision (for decimals)
	✅ How they are used

		A) What type of data they store:
			1) Integer Types (Whole Numbers):
				📌 byte:
					-Stores very small integers.
					-Usually 1 byte (8 bits).
					-Range: typically -128 to 127 (signed).
					-Used to save memory when storing small values.

				📌 short:
					-Usually 2 bytes (16 bits).
					-Range: -32,768 to 32,767.
					-Used when memory matters and values are not large.

				📌 int:
					-Usually 4 bytes (32 bits).
					-Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
					-Most commonly used integer type.

				📌 long:
					-Usually 8 bytes (64 bits).
					-Very large integer range.
					-Used when numbers exceed int limits.	

			2) Floating-Point Types (Decimal Numbers):
				📌 float:
					-Usually 4 bytes (32 bits).
					-Approx. 6–7 decimal digits precision.	

				📌 double:
					-Usually 8 bytes (64 bits).
					-Approx. 15–16 decimal digits precision.
					-More accurate than float.	
					-Most modern programs prefer double.

			3) Character Type:
				📌 char:
					-Usually 1 byte.
					-Stores a single character.
					-Actually stores ASCII/Unicode number internally.
			
			4) Text Type:
				📌 string:
					-Stores multiple characters (text).
					-Size depends on length.
					-Internally stored as an array of characters.


		🔎 Memory Size Summary (Typical 64-bit System):
			Type	Size (Bytes)	Stores			Precision / Range

			byte	1		Small integers		-128 to 127

			short	2		Integers		Small range

			int	4		Integers		Medium range

			long	8		Large integers		Very large range

			float	4		Decimals		~7 digits precision

			double	8		Decimals		~15 digits precision

			char	1		Single character	ASCII value
	
			string	Variable	Text			Depends on length


		🔹 Important Technical Notes:
			1️⃣ Sizes may vary by language
				-In C++, sizes depend on compiler and system.
				-In Java, sizes are fixed.

			2️⃣ Floating point precision
				-float and double follow IEEE 754 standard.

			3️⃣ String is not primitive (in many languages)
				-In C++ → class
				-In Java → class
				-In C → array of char

		🎯 When To Use What:
			-Use int → for normal counting.
			-Use long → for very large numbers.
			-Use double → for most decimal math.
			-Use float → when saving memory.
			-Use char → single character.
			-Use string → text.
			-Use byte/short → when memory optimization is required.

		🔹 What Is Boolean:
			-A boolean data type stores only two possible values:
				-true
				-false

			-It is mainly used for:
				-Conditions
				-Comparisons
				-Logical operations
			
			Size of Boolean:
				-The size depends on the language:

				Language	Type		Size

				C++		bool		Usually 1 byte

				C (C99+)	_Bool		Usually 1 byte

				Java		boolean		Not precisely defined (JVM dependent, typically 1 byte in arrays)

			How Boolean Is Stored Internally:
				Internally:
					-true is usually stored as 1
					-false is stored as 0

			Usage:
				Boolean is mainly used in:
					1️⃣ Conditions:
						if (isPassed) {
    							cout << "Success";
						}
					2️⃣ Logical Operations
						-AND → &&
						-OR → ||
						-NOT → !
							Example:
								bool result = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);

			When To Use Boolean:
				-When checking conditions.
				-When controlling loops.
				-When storing yes/no states.
				-When writing logical expressions.
